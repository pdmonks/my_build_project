# MyBuild Project #

This repository contains resources I developed to produce a full front and back-end web system for the final year project of my Software Engineering degree at MMU.

The system was implemented as a prototype designed for people who want to build their own PCs.  From the website, users choose components that are suggested to them based a selection of uses (general, gaming and workstation) and budgets (low, medium, high) and on compatibility with other components; starting with the CPU, then motherboard, cooler, RAM, GPU, storage, case and power supply.

The USPs are:
- the components would be sent to the user for them to construct their own system.
- an integrated knowledgebase with information on each component type, building advice, etc, to avoid users having to do time-consuming research on components before buying.

## Information ##

I have included my dissertation and the video presentation and PowerPoint slides I produced to demonstrate the system, to provide a full record of its design and development.

## Code ##

The front-end website was developed with HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX technologies to accommodate REST-structured HTTP requests and responses.

The back-end, constructed within an MVC design pattern, was coded in Java including a REST controller and suite of Hibernate utilities I developed during the year. 

## Database ##

The Hibernate utilities mapped and linked to a MySQL database; the scripts I developed to implement and populate the database are also included.
